# Detecting_Implicit_Bias_in_Traffic_Stops
Thinkful Unit 3 Supervised Learning Capstone Project

Further detail to be added

## A study into possible implicit bias in 2013-15 traffic stops.

The aim of this project is to analyze variations in road safety in the U.S. This will be done using a dataset containing details of fatal road accidents obtained from the National Hightway Traffic Safety Administration:

## Available Data

The data examined are from the NHTSA's road fatality database, the Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS). This study concentrates on 2016 data, although there were datasets in the FARS repository going back as far as 1975. The repository can be found at:

ftp://ftp.nhtsa.dot.gov/fars/

Each row in the dataset represents a particular fatal accident. Columns include the state in which the accident occurred, the number and types of vehicles involved, number of pedestrians involved, the time of day, the weather conditions, whether a driver was reported as being drunk at the scene, number of fatalities, and many others. The columns in the dataset are mostly coded; some of the columns' meanings could be deduced intuitively, whereas others had to be looked up. For this, it was necessary to consult the NHTSA's manual, which is located at:
